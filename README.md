## Project Proposal  

### Synopsis  
**Problem:** Current pose estimation tools (e.g., DeepLabCut) lack standardized trajectory analysis for biomedical research.  
**Solution:** Enhance `movement` with:  
1. **ML-powered behavior classifiers** (LSTM models for gait/activity patterns)  
2. **Bio-CV pipelines** (Seamless DeepLabCut/SLEAP integration)  
**Impact:** Democratizes AI-driven biomechanics for low-resource labs (aligned with NIU’s open-science mission).  

### Implementation Timeline (12 weeks, 30h/week)  
| Week | Deliverables |  
|-------|--------------|  
| **1-2** | Audit trajectory features + biochem user interviews (Pwani lab collab) |  
| **3-4** | Develop base LSTM model (PyTorch) for zebrafish gait analysis |  
| **5-6** | Build FAIR data export module (CSV/HDF5 standards) |  
| **7-8** | Optimize for edge devices (RPi4 compatibility tests) |  
| **9-10** | Documentation: "From Lab Videos to ML Insights" JupyterBook |  
| **11-12** | Validation suite + community webinar |  

**Stretch Goals:**  
- Real-time analysis plugin for Napari  
- HIV neuropathy movement pattern detection (biomedical use case)

### Communication Plan  
- **Daily:** Zulip async updates (+ GIFs of model outputs!)  
- **Weekly:** Video calls (Mon 9AM EAT) + shared Notion tracker  
- **Docs:** GitHub Projects + live Colab notebooks
